1. abcsort.py
	I first used three separate input statements to assign variables but then changed
it to a single line that returns a list of strings and maps everything to a, b and c ints
afterwards. Same goes for the main part of the script: I started by using buffers just
like an example from the lecture but then decided to reassign variables all at once with
a, b = b, a and so on.
	Overall, it was an insightful limitation that pushed me towards a 
different approach.  

2. strlist.py
	Similarly to the bash script with enumerating files, I initially tried using
string_count++ but it gave me an error (thought it was possible either way). I also think 
that the script won't work on nested lists because their type is list and therefore skipped
by the script.
